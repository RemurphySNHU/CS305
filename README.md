    *Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    -Artemis Financial is a financial institution that wishes to upgrade/modernize their existing software to comply with current security standards.  
    
    *What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    After idenetifying the vulnerabilities, implementing the code to mitigate was not very difficult.  Utilizing the built in JSSE encryption module was very straightforward.
    The vulnerability assesment flow diagram helped to identify issues that were not immediately recognized as such.  The OWASP dependency check plugin was a snap.  
    
    *What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    The manual code review for project two was kind of confusing because there wasn't any code to actually review..  The mitigation code was all that was there.
    A better application of this concept could have been used.
    
    *How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    In the future, I will definitely utilize the OWASP dependency check tool.  Layers of security were added by encapsulation, authentication, and security certificates.
    
    *How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    After implementing the mitigation code, I re-ran the dependency check plugin to make sure I didn't add any more potential vulnerabilities.  A manual code review, and unit testing were
    key tools for ensuring this upgrade would be successful.
    
    *What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    This project help to solidify the correct usage of classes, and identify many different attack vectors that were once unknown.  I primarilly used our textbook, and stack exchange
    to complete this project.  
    *Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I think I would choose to show this project as it involves a common framework and highlights the importance of secure coding.
